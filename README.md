# Inovative-Culinary-Robot
Welcome to the 'Innovative Culinary Robotics' project! This project involves the development of a robotic system for precision pattern dispensing in culinary applications, using an IAI Cartesian Robot controlled through a user-friendly web interface.

## System Design
The system combines mechanical, electronic, and software components. At its core is the IAI Cartesian Robot, equipped with a precision dispensing system.

## Software
We developed a web-based interface to control the robot, making it accessible and user-friendly. The software stack includes Python, Flask, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
